This file explains :
* how to use different classes and properties for modeling ontologies ;

(notice : creating/modifying/deleting is more related to the contributing file and it should be integrated to the contributed file as specifical rules)

## Using the current classes and properties

1) Use rather an `ontology term` and do not use `another ontology term` (only for requests)

## Creating new classes and properties

1) Do not duplicate the same difference in properties, classes and ranges/domains

We mean by do not duplicating e.g. do not create a class `a new ontolgy class` if `an existing ontology class` is enough since `the existing term` already includes it.

### Modifying a class or a property




## Deleting a class or a property

1) If a class is not necessary for the ontology and not justified by a motivating scenario, then this class can be delete.

We seek to express our ontology in the most minimalist and simplest way possible. 
We believe that the elegance of a formalism lies in its simplicity and generalization. 
Apply the philosophy of an Occam's razor.
