# use-cases folder

`./use-cases/` folder is meant to contain the different use cases that will compose the ontology.

A `use case` may be compared to a `motivating scenario` except while a motivating scenario is meant to determine which terms are needed to be implemented within the current iteration, a `use case` is meant to show the current description abilities at a given ontology version without implementing any new term. 

Each folder directly in `./use-cases/` is considered a use case.

Any `.ttl` file found int the hierarchy of this folder is considered a module.
