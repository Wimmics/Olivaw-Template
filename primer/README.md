# 1. Introduction

This document is an introduction to the *current* (prefix) ontology that is meant for ... .

Here is a detailed explanation of the ontology features.

The later sections of this document should provide you:

- high-level definitions of the key concepts of the current ontology
- simple scenarii for each of these concepts and their implementations both in [TURTLE] format and in RDF/XML

Finally this document ends with a summary of the features available in current ontology 

# 2. Overview of current ontology

This session is meant to explain the key classes of the HMAS ontology. We will go further into detail for each of them. Here is an overview of the structure of the main current ontology model.

... Space here reserved for a data model visualisation ...

The terms of this vocabulary are stored in different modules, namely:

- module 1: Provides the main concepts describing something
- module 2: Provides the needed terms to describe some specific aspects

## 2.1. Class 1

A very formal and accurate definition for Class 1.

## 2.2. Class 2

Another very formal and accurate definition for Class 2.

# 3. Examples of key concepts of current ontology

Now that we have an overview of the main classes available in current ontology, this section should provide for each of them a small scenario as well as an implementation of that scenario. Each implementation will be provided both in turtle format and in RDF/XML.

## 3.1. Class 1

Description of what is going to be described as Class 1 example.

<details>
<summary>Turtle Example</summary>
<pre lang="Turtle"><code>
Some valid turtle data snippet and the required prefixes so that a user would only need to copy/paste using the GitHub button.
&#10;
Some HTML special chars that could be useful:

* lower than: &#60;
* line break: &#10;
* space (for indent): &#32;
</code></pre>
</details>

<details>
<summary>XML Example</summary>
<pre lang="xml"><code>
Some valid and equivalent RDF/XML data snippet and the required prefixes so that a user would only need to copy/paste using the GitHub button.
&#10;
Some HTML special chars that could be useful:

* lower than: &#60;
* line break: &#10;
* space (for indent): &#32;
</code></pre>
</details>

## 3.2. Class 2

Description of what is going to be described as Class 2 example.

<summary>Turtle Example</summary>

# 4. Summary

The implementations of the previous section aims to illustrate the following features:

- this ontology can describe concept 1
- while also providing what it needs for concept 2
