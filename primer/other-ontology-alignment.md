# 1. Introduction

# 2. Current ontology module 1 and other ontology alignment
## 2.1 Current Class 1 and other ontology

A Other Class 1 is a subclass of Current Class 1 

```turtle
Some turtle example that express the alignment

&#10;
Some HTML special chars that could be useful:

* lower than: &#60;
* line break: &#10;
* space (for indent): &#32;
```

## 2.2 Current Class 2 and other ontology

Another alignment explanation between the one of the other ontology class and the current ontology. We can therefore represent:

```turtle
Some turtle example that express the alignment

&#10;
Some HTML special chars that could be useful:

* lower than: &#60;
* line break: &#10;
* space (for indent): &#32;
```

There can be more details about this aspect of the alignment, illustrated by the following data snippet:

```turtle
Some turtle example that express the alignment

&#10;
Some HTML special chars that could be useful:

* lower than: &#60;
* line break: &#10;
* space (for indent): &#32;
```
# 3. Current ontology module 2 and other ontology alignment

## 3.1 Current Class 3 and other ontology

### 3.1.1 Current Class 3 aspect A

There can be some additional explanation about an aspect that is important to consider for the alignment, with again some turtle data snippet.

```turtle
Some turtle example that express the alignment

&#10;
Some HTML special chars that could be useful:

* lower than: &#60;
* line break: &#10;
* space (for indent): &#32;
```

### 3.1.2 Current Class 3 aspect B

Another aspect of the alignment may be important, but with more subsections

**subsection A**

The following data expressed using the other ontology:

```turtle
Some turtle example that express the alignment

&#10;
Some HTML special chars that could be useful:

* lower than: &#60;
* line break: &#10;
* space (for indent): &#32;
```

Would be the following turtle data in the current ontology:

```turtle
Some turtle example that express the alignment

&#10;
Some HTML special chars that could be useful:

* lower than: &#60;
* line break: &#10;
* space (for indent): &#32;
```

**subsection B**

The following data expressed using the other ontology:

```turtle
Some turtle example that express the alignment

&#10;
Some HTML special chars that could be useful:

* lower than: &#60;
* line break: &#10;
* space (for indent): &#32;
```

Would be the following turtle data in the current ontology:

```turtle
Some turtle example that express the alignment

&#10;
Some HTML special chars that could be useful:

* lower than: &#60;
* line break: &#10;
* space (for indent): &#32;
```

# 4. Summary

In some complete and complex data that we would have described the following way in the other ontology:

```turtle
Some turtle example that express the alignment

&#10;
Some HTML special chars that could be useful:

* lower than: &#60;
* line break: &#10;
* space (for indent): &#32;
```

That same complete and complex data would have been described in the current ontology the following way:

```turtle
Some turtle example that express the alignment

&#10;
Some HTML special chars that could be useful:

* lower than: &#60;
* line break: &#10;
* space (for indent): &#32;
```
